SourceV1.
Source is an application developed to allow for people in the NSB 2026 cohort to give, and get resources for their assessments. It allows people to share their assessments, to gain access to others assessments for a variety of subjects. As new assessment tasks for the NSB 2026 cohort are distributed, channels for respective tasks will be created, with submissions of other's assessment tasks.
Developed with pycord.
