## SourceV1

**SourceV1** is a Discord bot built to streamline the sharing and organisation of academic assessment resources within a server. It provides a structured, channel-based system where users can submit and retrieve assessment materials across multiple subjects, improving collaboration and reducing fragmentation of resources.

As new assessment tasks are introduced, SourceV1 supports the creation of task-specific channels to ensure submissions remain organised, discoverable, and relevant. This prevents resource clutter and enables users to quickly locate materials associated with a particular task or subject.

The bot is developed using **Pycord**, leveraging Discord’s interaction framework to provide reliable command handling and scalable server integration.

## Key Features
